# hyperULE Docs

## Intro

hyperULE is a small and simple language with basic features and C-like syntax.

The main goals are as following:

- Continue to learn the inner workings of a compiler, especially transpiling into a shitty, less powerful language.
- Learning basic compiler optimizations
- Continue learning Rust ðŸ¦€
- *Bring DX features to to ULE based HHR:*
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Structs
  - Type-Safety
- *Work around common but hard-to-debug issues in ULE:*
  - `StrToInt(derp + """)`
- *If successful:*
  - *Create backend for Zebra, Newland/Lua and Cognex?*
  
    *--> One code for every platform*
